# ðŸš€ Simple Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy

Just run this command from the root directory:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

Or use npm:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## What This Does

1. âœ… Builds the React app
2. âœ… Copies build files to root directory
3. âœ… Commits and pushes to main branch
4. âœ… GitHub Pages automatically serves from main branch

## Manual Deploy

If you prefer to do it step by step:

```bash
# 1. Build the app
npm run build

# 2. Copy build files to root
cp -r frontend/build/* .

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "ðŸš€ Deploy update"
git push origin main
```

## GitHub Pages Setup

Make sure your GitHub repository settings have:
- **Source**: Deploy from a branch
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Folder**: `/ (root)`

## Troubleshooting

- If build fails: Check `frontend/` directory and run `npm install` there
- If deploy fails: Make sure you have git access and the remote is set up
- If page is blank: Wait 2-5 minutes for GitHub Pages to update

## Development

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Install dependencies
npm run install-deps
```

That's it! Much simpler than the old gh-pages approach. ðŸŽ‰
